Most commonly used tools for taking care of linting, testing, and building in Ruby:
1. Linting: RuboCop is a Ruby code style checker (linter) and formatter based on the community-driven Ruby Style Guide.
2. Testing: RSpec is one of the best Ruby testing frameworks and a successful testing solution for its code. 
3. Building: Ruby's built-in gem command can be used to create, install, and manage gems (packages) for the application. 

Alternatives to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions:
1. Travis CI: Travis CI is a popular CI service that can be used to build and test Ruby applications. It has good integration with GitHub and supports a wide range of languages and frameworks.
2. CircleCI: CircleCI is a cloud-based CI/CD platform that can be used to build, test, and deploy Ruby applications. It has a simple configuration process and can be integrated with popular code hosting platforms like GitHub and Bitbucket.
3. GitLab CI/CD: GitLab CI/CD is a built-in CI/CD tool that is part of the GitLab code hosting platform. It can be used to build, test, and deploy Ruby applications and has good integration with GitLab's other features, such as issue tracking and merge requests.
4. Codeship: Codeship is a cloud-based CI/CD platform that can be used to build, test, and deploy Ruby applications. It has a simple configuration process and supports a wide range of languages and frameworks.

The decision to use a self-hosted or cloud-based CI environment for a small Ruby project depends on several factors such as cost, infrastructure, maintenance, features, security. For a small project in Ruby, a cloud-based CI environment may be the best choice, as it offers the benefits of preconfigured infrastructure, automatic updates, and a range of features.
